        This little application is greatly indebted to the free/libre software and data contributed by the Perseus project. In the same spirit of openness I hope that verba-android can be of use to others.
        Source is available from https://github.com/grantham/verba-android. Hack away!

Verba-Android is released under the GPL v3 license and is based on the database produced by the Verba-Console project (see http://www.magnopere.org/index.html#verba-console)\n
\n
The underlying data in this database comes from two sources:\n
\n
1. An Elementary Latin Dictionary (1895) by Charlton T. Lewis (see http://www.archive.org/details/anelementarylat01lewigoog).  This work is in the public domain, but was encoded into TEI by the Tufts University Perseus Project (http://www.perseus.tufts.edu) and the TEI-encoded XML file is released under the Creative Commons ShareAlike 3.0 License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/). I understand the copyright claim can only pertain to the XML encoding the project provided and cannot extend to the underlying work which is already in the public domain.\n
\n
2. A Latin morphology file produced by the Perseus Project (http://www.perseus.tufts.edu), and and which (as far as I can tell) is licensed under Mozilla Public License 1.1 (MPL 1.1) (see http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html)\n
\n
Because of its use of the above-mentioned morphology file, the verba-console app is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 1.1 (MPL 1.1) with the option to also license under the GPL. Note that Verba-Android does not use either of the above-mentioned Perseus project files, but rather depends on the output of a program which is licensed in a compatible way to the sources it uses.\n
