The file verba.jpg is actually a gzipped sqlite3 database!

The file name was given a jpg extensions because the Android platform refuses to let a non-image asset be
copied/moved/decompressed in excess of about 1MB.

This file contains the entire Latin-English lexicon and all of the morphological analyses.
